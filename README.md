# MiBECoM - A Minimal Blog Engine for Code Monkeys

MiBECoM is a blog engine based on JavaScript and Markdown. It has been mainly motivated
by the frustration I usually feel when Wordpress auto-escapes certain characters
(`['<', '>', '&', '"']` and others) inside code blocks, every time I edit a post.

MiBECoM is partly inspired by Github Pages and Jekyll

An auto-referential, almost up to date instance of [MiBECoM is online here](www.codevomit.xyz/blog).

### Features

* Not user friendly
* No database
* Only static content served through a web server
* Posts are written in Markdown
* Emphasis on code presentation

## Usage
MiBECoM is currently in super early stage (not much more than a POC, actually)
so expect to find a lot of  sharp corners.

You can clone the project and (build | run | test | etc) it with **Npm**, **Bower** and **Gulp**.

In order to publish your contents, place your posts inside `app/posts` and update `conf.json` accordingly.
